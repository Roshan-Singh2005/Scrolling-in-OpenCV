# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Scroll Controller

**This is my 1st GitHub repository!** 🚀

This project is a Python-based computer vision application that allows you to control mouse scrolling using simple hand gestures.

**Built with:**
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* PyAutoGUI

## ✅ Features

* **Touchless Control:** Scroll web pages, PDFs, and documents without touching the mouse.
* **Gesture Recognition:** Uses Google's MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking.
* **Stealth Mode:** Can run in the background (hidden window) while still detecting gestures.
* **Global Kill Switch:** Press 'q' at any time to terminate the program, even if the camera window is hidden.
* **Smooth Logic:** Prioritizes specific gestures to prevent accidental scrolling while moving your hand.
## 🛠️ Prerequisites
* **You need Python 3.x installed. The project relies on the following libraries:**
*     👉🏼pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui keyboard
## 📦 Dependencies
* **OpenCV** - For image processing.
* **MediaPipe** - For hand landmark detection.
* **PyAutoGUI** - For controlling the mouse.
* **Keyboard** - For global key detection.

## CONTROLS :-
* 1. Point Index UP   -> SCROLL UP
* 2. Point Index DOWN -> SCROLL DOWN
* 3. Open Palm        -> PAUSE
* 4. Fist             -> IDLE
